# White Eyedropper Re-Color

**Live Demo:**
https://stephensmetana.github.io/white-eyedropper/

A simple, modern web app for white point auto-correction (GIMP-style) using an eyedropper tool. Drag and drop an image, click an area that should be white, and the app will automatically adjust the image's white balance. Download the recolored result with one click.

## Features
- Drag and drop or click to upload an image
- Click on the original image to set the white point
- Instantly see the recolored result side by side
- Download the corrected image
- Responsive, modern UI

## How it works
1. **Upload**: Drag and drop an image into the left area, or click to select a file.
2. **Pick White Point**: Click on a spot in the image that should be pure white. The app will adjust the image so that point becomes white, correcting the color balance.
3. **Download**: Click "Download Recolored Image" to save the result.
